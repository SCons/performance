Windows results
###############

The results in this folder were measured on an AMD 2600 machine (4GB), running Windows XP (Home Edition, 32bit).
Software stack:

 * mingw-32, v4.6.2
 * python 2.7.2
 * ptime 1.0
 * perl 5.16.3 (ActiveState)
 * SCons v1.2.0

All single runs were done manually with ptime, that's why the timing results format differs from the other folders.
